# Object-Oriented-Javascript
This is a start to build a game maker project using Object Oriented Javascript.
I have started it with a basing HTML Javascript project as of now.
I am planning to develop it further using MEAN stack.

As a part of our Academic course, we developed it using Java Swings. But it is very difficult to convert it into 
web application as Java webstart is outdated and has security concerns.


The entry point for the application is index.html in side app folder.
All the Javascript files has been kept under app/scripts and divided logically.
